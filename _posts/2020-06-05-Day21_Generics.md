- Objective
    - Today we're discussing Generics; be aware that not all languages support this construct, so fewer languages are enabled for this challenge. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

- Task
    - Write a single generic function named printArray; this function must take an array of generic elements as a parameter (the exception to this is C++, which takes a vector). The locked Solution class in your editor tests your function.

- Note: You must use generics to solve this challenge. Do not write overloaded functions.

- Input Format
    - The locked Solution class in your editor will pass different types of arrays to your printArray function.

- Constraints
    - You must have exactly 1 function named printArray.
- Output Format
    - Your printArray function should print each element of its generic array parameter on a new line.
