# The PADS

- URL : <https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-pads/problem>{target="_blank"}
- Generate the following two result sets:
- Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
- Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:
- There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
- where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.
- Note: There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.

```sql
select concat(name, "(", substr(occupation,1,1),")") as name
from occupations
order by name asc;

select concat('There are a total of ', count(occupation),' ', lower(occupation),'s.') as total     
from occupations
group by occupation
order by total asc;
```
