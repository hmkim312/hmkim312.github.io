- Objective
    - In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math. Check out the Tutorial tab to learn more.

- Task
    - Given an integer,n, print its first 10  multiples. Each multiple n x i (where 1 <= i <= 10 ) should be printed on a new line in the form: n x i = result.

- Input Format

    - A single integer, n.

- Constraints
    - 2 <= n <= 20
- Output Format

    - Print 10 lines of output; each line i (where  1 <= i <= 10 ) contains the result of n x i in the form: n x i = result.


```python
import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys



if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f'{n} x {i} = {i * n}')
```

    2 x 1 = 2
    2 x 2 = 4
    2 x 3 = 6
    2 x 4 = 8
    2 x 5 = 10
    2 x 6 = 12
    2 x 7 = 14
    2 x 8 = 16
    2 x 9 = 18
    2 x 10 = 20
